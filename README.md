This ReadMe file is for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Project. The dataset used for this project is from UCI's Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0.

This repository contains the R code: run_analysis.R, the CodeBook, and a new tidy dataset.

This repository does not contain the original dataset. If you are interested in the original dataset, please click here:https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Rcode: run_analysis.R contains the R script that completes the 5 steps outlined in the project's direction.

CodeBook.md: The code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data

Tidydataset.txt: This is an independent tidy dataset that contains the average of each mean and standard deviation variable fore each activity and each subject. This is the output of step 5 outlined in the project's instructions
